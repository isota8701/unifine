1) re defined latent z and latent n_z for predicting coordinates
2) should i add kld loss for n_mu, n_log_var?
3) should the mlp predicting mu, log_var, n_mu, n_log_var parameter shared or not?
4) lattice loss is too large, should i split dense graph and spread graph each?
5) to decide 4) i should check the validity of predicted lattice for my first milestone
6) for 5) the cdvae eval_utils file might help
7) check the coord loss fn working well
8) to wrap up, if 1to7 works, i should clean up the dataset.py and model.py for purpose
9) reporting at AOI should be done at level 5)

updated the edge attr of spread graph to atom weights, not ones..

dense graph y prediction loss
1) GAT 1head no residual: 0.4~0.9
2) dynamic edge conv is better
3) roost 4head with residual: 0.9 ~ 1.1 -> even worse than GAT, no architecure benefits
spread graph y prediction loss
1) GAT 1head no residual: 1.3~1.9 -> 2times worse than dense graph

lattice loss not good
i think if im gonna stick with strategy 2 (spread graph)
i should build some variants of GIN or dynamic edge whith edge update in loop
test spread graph edge attr with ones or with atom weights
