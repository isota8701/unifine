idea is to drop and replace cdvae encoder to formula net
but since i think we need to predict 3d atom types and numbers and lattice
how about 2 encoders and z matching between 2, subset of contrastive learning perhaps



01.20
first implemented cdvae with formula encoder
but if loss backprop is done, the build graph makes error!
'''
assert block_inc == 0  # Implementing this is not worth the effort
RuntimeError: Boolean value of Tensor with more than one value is ambiguous
'''
first check cdvae loss for 3d gnn(dimenet encoder)
and then code contrastive learning and see loss decrease
between code contrastive learning and property prediction acc for only formula net
issue) contrastive with hiddens or mu or z check which is best
